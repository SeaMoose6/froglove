    <p>Basic considerations when locationg a strawberry patch include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Full sun</li>
        <li>Well drained, sandly loam with soil pH from 5.8 to 6.2 is ideal</li>
        <li>Don't plant where tomatoes, potatoes, peppers or eggplant have been grown recently</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Start with a rich, organic soil. Apply a balanced fertilizer(10-10-10)at planting at the rate of one poun per 100 sq. ft. Fertilize again after renovation of Fune bearers or second harvest of day neutrals and everbearing types. Do not over fertilize or you will have excessive leaf growth and poor flowering. Do not fertilizer strawberries late in the season in colder climate to prevent new growth that will be damaged by frost.</p>
